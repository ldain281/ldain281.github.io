<p>Most people travel to Costa Rica for the spectacular beaches or to visit the animal-filled rain forests, but I prefer the volcanos. They can blend flawlesly into the tropical landscape, pop into view out of nowhere or loom over everything in site. Some are covered with tropical trees, others are scarred, barren and rocky.</p>

<h4>Top three volcano tourism facts</h4>

<li>You can drive all the way to the top of Irazú and Poás on good quality paved roads.</li>

<p>Currently the most active volcano is Turrialba (<i>White Tower</i>). You can see if it's erupting now on the <a href="http://www.ovsprivado.una.ac.cr/images/stories/liveturrialba/camara.jpg?1484370941541">ovsicori-una live webcam</a>. For the past two years Turrialba has spread ash over the central valley nearly every month. One year proceeding the big 2015 eruption my family and I had the amazing opportunity to go the the peak, don gas masks and look into the smoking crater.</p>
<p><a href="table.html">Costa Ricas volcanos</a> span a <a href="http://www.play-costa-rica.com/images/page-pics/map-of-volcanoes.jpg">NW-SE cordillera line</a> starting with Orosí in the North near Nicaragua and ending with Irazú. I've climbed half of them and hope to climb the other five some day.</p>
